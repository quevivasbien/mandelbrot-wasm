# mandelbrot-wasm

Just a basic web app for exploring the Mandelbrot set. Run `build.sh` to compile the Rust code to WebAssembly. You will need `wasm-pack` installed to do this; run `cargo install wasm-pack` to install if you don't already have it.

See it in action [here](https://quevivasbien.github.io/apps/mandelbrot-wasm/).
